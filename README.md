## Overview

### The Simon Game
- This game is modelled off the game Simon. Users can press the start button or any key to start.
- The game will show users the tile they will have to click on.
- As they go from level to level, patterns get more and more complicated.
- When users get the pattern wrong, the game tells them it is game over and they can press any key or the restart button to start again.
